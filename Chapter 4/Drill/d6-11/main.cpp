/*
Now change the body of the loop so that it reads just one double each
time around. Define two variables to keep track of which is the smallest
and which is the largest value you have seen so far. Each time through
the loop write out the value entered. If it’s the smallest so far, write the
smallest so far after the number. If it is the largest so far, write the largest
so far after the number.
*/

/*
Add a unit to each double entered; that is, enter values such as 10cm,
2.5in, 5ft, or 3.33m. Accept the four units: cm, m, in, ft. Assume conversion
factors 1m == 100cm, 1in == 2.54cm, 1ft == 12in. Read the unit
indicator into a string. You may consider 12 m (with a space between the
number and the unit) equivalent to 12m (without a space).
*/

/*
Reject values without units or with “illegal” representations of units, such
as y, yard, meter, km, and gallons.
*/

/*
Keep track of the sum of values entered (as well as the smallest and the
largest) and the number of values entered. When the loop ends, print the
smallest, the largest, the number of values, and the sum of values. Note
that to keep the sum, you have to decide on a unit to use for that sum; use
meters.
*/

/*
Keep all the values entered (converted into meters) in a vector. At the
end, write out those values.
*/

/*
Before writing out the values from the vector, sort them (that’ll make
them come out in increasing order).
